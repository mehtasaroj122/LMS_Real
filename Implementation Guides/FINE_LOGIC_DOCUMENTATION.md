## Overview

The fine calculation system automatically calculates and manages fines for overdue, lost, and damaged books based on the `fine_settings` table. The system is designed to:

- **Automatically calculate fines** when books are returned late
- **Apply penalties** for lost or damaged books
- **Enforce grace periods** before charging begins
- **Cap maximum fines** to prevent excessive charges
- **Track all fine transactions** with payment status
- **Schedule daily automated processing** of overdue books

---

## Fine Calculation Logic

### 1. Overdue Fine Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Days Late = Return Date - Due Date

If Days Late ≤ Grace Period Days:
    Fine Amount = ₹0 (No charge)
Else:
    Chargeable Days = Days Late - Grace Period Days
    Fine Amount = Chargeable Days × Per Day Fine
    
Final Amount = MIN(Fine Amount, Max Fine Amount)
```

**Parameters from `fine_settings` table:**
- `per_day_fine`: Amount charged per day of overdue (Default: ₹5.00)
- `grace_period_days`: Days allowed before fine starts (Default: 2 days)
- `max_fine_amount`: Maximum cap on total fine (Default: ₹500.00)
- `issue_duration_days`: Standard borrowing period (Default: 14 days)

### 2. Lost Book Penalty

**Formula:**
```
Fine Amount = lost_book_penalty (from fine_settings)
Status: lost
Remarks: "Lost book penalty"
```

**Parameters:**
- `lost_book_penalty`: Fixed penalty for lost books (Default: ₹1000.00)

### 3. Damaged Book Penalty

**Formula:**
```
Fine Amount = damaged_book_penalty (from fine_settings)
Status: damaged
Remarks: "Damaged book penalty"
```

**Parameters:**
- `damaged_book_penalty`: Fixed penalty for damaged books (Default: ₹250.00)

---

## Configuration

### Fine Settings Table
**Database Table:** `fine_settings`

```sql
CREATE TABLE fine_settings (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    per_day_fine DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 5.00,
    grace_period_days INT DEFAULT 2,
    max_fine_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 500.00,
    lost_book_penalty DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 1000.00,
    damaged_book_penalty DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 250.00,
    issue_duration_days INT DEFAULT 14,
    max_books_per_student INT DEFAULT 5,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Fines Table
**Database Table:** `fines`

```sql
CREATE TABLE fines (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    issued_book_id BIGINT (Foreign Key),
    student_id BIGINT (Foreign Key),
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    days_late INT,
    status ENUM('pending', 'paid', 'waived') DEFAULT 'pending',
    paid_on DATE,
    payment_method ENUM('cash', 'card', 'online'),
    remarks VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### IssuedBooks Table
**Database Table:** `issued_books`

```sql
-- Additional columns used for fine calculation:
fine_amount DECIMAL(10, 2)   -- Current fine amount on this book
due_date DATE                -- When book is due
return_date DATE             -- When book was returned (NULL if not returned)
status ENUM('issued', 'returned', 'lost', 'damaged', 'pending')
```

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Normal Overdue Fine

**Scenario:**
- Book due date: January 20, 2026
- Book returned: January 25, 2026
- Per day fine: ₹5
- Grace period: 2 days
- Max fine: ₹500

**Calculation:**
```
Days Late = Jan 25 - Jan 20 = 5 days
Days within grace period = 2 days
Chargeable days = 5 - 2 = 3 days
Fine amount = 3 × ₹5 = ₹15
Final fine = MIN(₹15, ₹500) = ₹15
```

**Result:** Fine of **₹15** is generated with status "pending"

---

### Example 2: Maximum Fine Cap

**Scenario:**
- Book due date: January 1, 2026
- Book returned: January 30, 2026
- Per day fine: ₹5
- Grace period: 2 days
- Max fine: ₹500

**Calculation:**
```
Days Late = Jan 30 - Jan 1 = 29 days
Days within grace period = 2 days
Chargeable days = 29 - 2 = 27 days
Fine amount = 27 × ₹5 = ₹135
Final fine = MIN(₹135, ₹500) = ₹135
```

**Result:** Fine of **₹135** is generated

---

### Example 3: Extremely Overdue with Cap

**Scenario:**
- Book due date: January 1, 2026
- Book returned: August 1, 2026 (Very late!)
- Per day fine: ₹5
- Grace period: 2 days
- Max fine: ₹500

**Calculation:**
```
Days Late = Aug 1 - Jan 1 = 212 days
Days within grace period = 2 days
Chargeable days = 212 - 2 = 210 days
Fine amount = 210 × ₹5 = ₹1050
Final fine = MIN(₹1050, ₹500) = ₹500  ← CAPPED
```

**Result:** Fine of **₹500** (capped) is generated

---

### Example 4: Lost Book

**Scenario:**
- Book marked as lost
- Lost book penalty: ₹1000
- Grace period: Not applicable

**Calculation:**
```
Fine amount = ₹1000 (Fixed)
Status = "lost"
Remarks = "Lost book penalty"
```

**Result:** Fine of **₹1000** is generated immediately

---

### Example 5: Damaged Book

**Scenario:**
- Book returned damaged
- Damaged book penalty: ₹250
- Grace period: Not applicable

**Calculation:**
```
Fine amount = ₹250 (Fixed)
Status = "damaged"
Remarks = "Damaged book penalty"
```

**Result:** Fine of **₹250** is generated immediately

---

### Example 6: Within Grace Period (No Fine)

**Scenario:**
- Book due date: January 20, 2026
- Book returned: January 21, 2026 (1 day late)
- Per day fine: ₹5
- Grace period: 2 days
- Max fine: ₹500

**Calculation:**
```
Days Late = Jan 21 - Jan 20 = 1 day
Grace period = 2 days
Since 1 day ≤ 2 days → No fine charged
Fine amount = ₹0
```

**Result:** **No fine** is generated, book marked as returned

## Important Notes

1. **Grace Period:** Fines are only charged after the grace period expires
2. **Maximum Cap:** Even if book is extremely late, fine won't exceed `max_fine_amount`
3. **Automatic Processing:** Always runs without manual intervention (scheduled daily)
4. **Lost/Damaged:** These are fixed penalties, grace period doesn't apply
5. **Fine Creation:** Fine record is created only if amount > 0
6. **Activity Logging:** All fine events are logged for audit trail
7. **Thread-Safe:** Scheduled job prevents duplicate processing

## Testing Fine Logic

### Test Case 1: Normal Overdue
```
Issue date: Jan 1
Due date: Jan 15
Return date: Jan 20
Expected fine: (20-15-2) × 5 = ₹15 ✓
```

### Test Case 2: Within Grace Period
```
Issue date: Jan 1
Due date: Jan 15
Return date: Jan 16 (1 day late)
Expected fine: ₹0 (within 2-day grace) ✓
```

### Test Case 3: Lost Book
```
Status: lost
Expected fine: ₹1000 ✓
```

### Test Case 4: Damaged Book
```
Status: damaged
Expected fine: ₹250 ✓
```

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Fine not calculated for overdue book?**
- Check if book's `return_date` is set (NULL means still borrowed)
- Run manual command: `php artisan fines:calculate-overdue`
- Check if FineSetting is active (`is_active = 1`)

**Q: Same fine calculated multiple times?**
- System updates existing fine record, doesn't create duplicates
- Check issued_book_id uniqueness in fines table

**Q: Fine amount seems wrong?**
- Verify fine_settings values in database
- Check if max_fine_amount is too low
- Manually verify using formula above
